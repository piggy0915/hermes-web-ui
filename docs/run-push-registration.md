# Per-run push snapshots

## App relay notification ownership

The App's versioned `app.event` stream (Android native background notifications
and foreground banners) authorizes each live event and reconnect snapshot by the
authenticated **Studio login user ID**, in addition to existing Profile and
interaction permissions. Legacy `app.notification`, `app.group-notification`
and `app.workflow-notification` projections use the same ownership check.

- Single-chat notifications belong to the persisted session's `user_id`.
- Group notifications belong only to the room's `ownerAuthUserId`. Membership,
  shared Profile access and a super-admin role do not grant notification access.
  Approval notifications additionally require permission to handle that request.
- Workflow notifications belong to the initiating `workflow_runs.user_id`,
  saved on admission from the authenticated user (or the schedule owner).
  Node interactions and plans resolve their persisted root run, including nodes
  executing in a different Profile.

Multiple connections belonging to the same owner may receive the event. Missing
or deleted subjects and records with no owner fail closed; old workflow runs are
not assigned to whoever is currently connected. Clients cannot override the
owner through subscription filters or event payloads. This changes notification
delivery only; shared workspace viewing and task execution permissions are separate.

This relay policy does not change the separate immutable APNs snapshot delivery
contract described below.

Studio stores the initiating App identity and immutable notification data when accepting a root run. It does not manage push credential registration, refresh, expiry synchronization or receiver replacement.

## Admission

- Single chat: the App `run` event includes optional `push_snapshot`. Studio creates an independent root run ID and captures metadata before queuing. The snapshot field is removed before dispatching the chat input to agent execution. The socket later draining a queued run cannot change its destination.
- Group chat: the human message ID is the root run ID. The message submission carries its snapshot; trusted child/handoff links retain the original target. Snapshot credentials are not persisted in group messages or broadcast to members.
- Workflow: `POST /api/studio/workflows/:id/run` accepts the optional snapshot alongside the existing input. Admission persists it with the newly created workflow run; node runs inherit the root target.
- Web/scheduled/guest executions do not infer a phone recipient. Missing/invalid optional push data produces a run without a notification snapshot, never a backfill or fallback to another phone.

## Stored data

`run_push_targets` contains `kind`, `profile`, `run_id`, `subject_id`, the authenticated local user and phone installation, **`studio_device_id`**, and `push_snapshot_ciphertext`. The Studio ID comes from `getAppRelayDeviceIdentity().device_id`, the same identity used by App LAN/cloud connections. It is not the phone's `device_id`, a socket ID, or an App connection list ID. Body-supplied Studio/installation IDs must match before accepting a snapshot.

The snapshot is encrypted using AES-256-GCM and a mode-0600 `.push-token-key` under `config.appHome`. It includes only platform, application/environment, APNs address, dedicated push token/grant ID, cloud account and destination Studio/installation. App login tokens and claimed expiry are not copied. Token renewal/rotation, switching accounts or connecting another Studio cannot overwrite an existing run. `run_push_links` maps child runs/messages to the same immutable root.

## Reading and routing

`readRunPushNotification(ref)` reads only the selected run, decrypts its snapshot and returns a credential/recipient pair plus a separate allowlisted click route. The route contains `studio_device_id`, `cloud_user_id`, `run_kind`, `run_id`, `profile` and the appropriate session/room/workflow ID. Credential/address fields do not appear in the click route or public events. It does not consult a mutable device table or a local expiry cache.

The App uses this route to reconnect the saved Studio before opening the task. A removed/unreachable original connection or account mismatch must not redirect the notification to another Studio.

## Event-driven delivery

`services/notifications/run-push.ts` is an independent consumer of the webhook business-event hub. `ensureBusinessConsumers()` installs it for both chat and domain producers, so a workflow/group event can be the first event after startup; it does not depend on a foreground App socket or a configured HTTP webhook endpoint.

| Webhook event | Push category |
| --- | --- |
| `chat.run.completed`, `chat.run.failed` | completion / failure |
| `chat.approval.requested`, `chat.clarification.requested` | approval / interaction |
| `group.message.created` (final assistant reply), `group.run.failed` | completion / failure |
| `group.approval.requested`, `group.clarification.requested` | approval / interaction |
| `workflow.run.completed`, `workflow.run.failed` | completion / failure |

The group producers publish persisted reply/error facts and authenticated pending-interaction facts. Group runtime IDs link to the initiating root. Workflow nodes inherit the workflow root; their completion/failure events do not produce extra push notifications. Workflow node approvals are currently automatically answered with `once`, so they do not produce a user-action push; a node clarification retains the root workflow destination. Resolved interactions remain webhook events but do not send another push. Interrupted/replayed events, tool progress, missing snapshots and Android snapshots are skipped.

For each accepted event Studio reads only its immutable run snapshot and POSTs once to `/push/v1/send` on `config.appRelay.url`. The dedicated credential goes in `Authorization: Bearer`; the JSON contract is `{schema_version:1,event_id,event_type,recipient,notification:{title,body},ekko_run}`. `recipient` contains the saved platform/app/environment/APNs address, and `ekko_run` contains the saved click route. Titles/previews are bounded, with raw errors, commands and tool output excluded. The account server's pending endpoint must supply a generic notification when the preview is empty.

A bounded in-memory set suppresses duplicate terminal/interaction events (chat/workflow by root, group replies by response run/message). There is no persisted delivery history or replay after restart. The request has a 10-second timeout and rejects redirects. Every response, including 401/429/5xx, and every network failure ends the attempt; no credential checks/renewals, repairs, retries, delivery outbox or later backfill occur. Push errors do not affect the run or other consumers.

The account server's APNs send endpoint and signed-device validation are still pending. The Studio consumer and request contract are implemented; actual APNs delivery cannot work until that endpoint is implemented and configured. Existing Android notification behavior is unchanged.
